# Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models, or LLMs, are sophisticated probabilistic models of text that utilize vast amounts of data to understand and generate human-like language. At their core, LLMs compute probabilities for sequences of
 words based on the patterns and structures they've learned from the data they were trained on.

Imagine you have a sentence like "I went to the zoo to send me a pet. They sent me a--". A language model like LLM would calculate the probability of various words to fill in the blank based on its understanding of language.
It assigns probabilities to each word in its vocabulary, considering the context provided by the preceding words.

What makes LLMs 'large' is the sheer number of parameters they possess, which enable them to capture intricate nuances of language. However, there isn't a strict threshold defining when a model becomes 'large'.
Despite the term 'large', it's crucial to note that LLMs encompass various sizes, from massive models like GPT-3 to smaller ones like BERT.

These models excel not only in predicting words but also in generating coherent and contextually appropriate text. They achieve this through sophisticated architectures that process input text and generate output text
in a manner resembling human language production.

In essence, LLMs represent a significant advancement in natural language processing, enabling applications ranging from automated content generation to language translation and beyond.
