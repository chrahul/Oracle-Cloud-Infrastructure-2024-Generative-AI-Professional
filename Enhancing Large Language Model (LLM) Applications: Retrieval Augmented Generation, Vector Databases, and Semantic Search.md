Building blocks of an LLM application as part of the OCI Generative AI, focusing on retrieval augmented generation and semantic search:

1. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
   - RAG allows large language models (LLMs) to handle a broader range of queries without the need for exponentially larger training datasets.
   - It integrates retrieval-based methods with generative models, combining the strengths of both approaches for more effective text generation.
   - RAG typically involves retrieving relevant context or information from a database or corpus and incorporating it into the generative model's input to enhance the quality and relevance of the generated responses.

2. **Vector Databases**:
   - Rack-based LLMs utilize vector databases to store and retrieve contextual information and embeddings associated with text passages or documents.
   - Vector databases efficiently index and query embeddings generated by LLMs, enabling faster and more accurate retrieval of relevant context for augmentation during text generation.
   - By leveraging vector databases, LLMs can access a vast amount of contextual information to produce more contextually relevant and accurate responses.

3. **Semantic Search**:
   - Semantic search enhances traditional keyword-based search by considering the context and meaning of the user's query.
   - It relies on semantic understanding and natural language processing techniques to interpret the user's intent and retrieve relevant information or documents.
   - Semantic search algorithms analyze the context, relationships, and semantics of the query and the available data to provide more accurate and contextually appropriate search results.
   - By understanding the meaning behind the user's query, semantic search can deliver more relevant and insightful responses, improving the overall search experience.

These building blocks enable LLM applications to perform retrieval augmented generation, leveraging vector databases for efficient context retrieval and semantic search techniques to understand and respond to user queries more effectively.
