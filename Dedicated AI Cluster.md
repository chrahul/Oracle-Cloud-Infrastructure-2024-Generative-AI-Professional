- **Dedicated AI Cluster Unit Types**:
  - **Large Cohere**: Supports Cohere command base model for hosting or fine-tuning.
  - **Small Cohere**: Supports Cohere command light model for hosting or fine-tuning.
  - **Embed Cohere**: Supports Cohere embed model for hosting.
  - **Llama 2-70**: Supports Llama 2 models, especially Llama2 70-billion chat model for hosting.

- **Unit Size Requirements for Hosting and Fine-Tuning**:
  - **Text Generation**:
    - **Cohere Command Model**:
      - Fine-tuning: Requires two units of large Cohere.
      - Hosting: Requires a minimum of one unit of large Cohere.
    - **Cohere Command Light Model**:
      - Requires two units of small Cohere for fine-tuning.
      - Hosting: Requires a minimum of one unit of small Cohere.
    - **Llama 2 70 Billion Chat Model**:
      - Does not support fine-tuning; requires one unit for hosting.
    - **Summarization**:
      - Can use Cohere command for hosting, does not support fine-tuning.
    - **Embedding**:
      - Does not support fine-tuning; requires one unit for hosting.

- **Example Scenario**:
  - **Fine-Tuning Cluster**:
    - Requires two units of large Cohere.
    - Used for fine-tuning Cohere command model.
    - Each cluster active for five hours.
  - **Hosting Cluster**:
    - Requires one unit of large Cohere.
    - Used for hosting fine-tuned models.
    - Active for the entire month.

- **Pricing Calculation**:
  - **Fine-Tuning Cost**:
    - Multiply the number of units (2) by the number of active hours per cluster (5) for each week.
    - Total fine-tuning cost for the month is the sum of all unit hours (2 units * 5 hours * 4 weeks).
  - **Hosting Cost**:
    - Minimum commitment is 744 unit hours for the entire month.
    - Total hosting cost for the month is 744 unit hours.
  - **Total Cost**:
    - Sum of fine-tuning and hosting costs.
    - Multiply the total unit hours by the price per unit hour for the large Cohere dedicated unit.
