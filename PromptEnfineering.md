- **Introduction to Prompting**:
  - Prompting involves altering the content or structure of the input provided to a language model to influence its output.
  - It can be used to exert control over the distribution of vocabulary words generated by the model.
  - Two primary ways to influence the model's output are prompting and training.

- **Prompt Engineering**:
  - Prompt engineering involves iteratively refining the model input to induce a desired probability distribution for a specific task.
  - It aims to construct prompts that elicit favorable model behavior for the task at hand.
  - Prompt engineering can be challenging and unpredictable due to the complex interactions between the input and the model's output.

- **In-Context Learning**:
  - In-context learning refers to constructing prompts with demonstrations of the task the model is meant to perform.
  - It typically involves including examples or instructions relevant to the task within the prompt.
  - In-context learning can improve model performance by providing task-specific guidance during generation.

- **K-Shot Prompting**:
  - K-shot prompting involves including k examples or demonstrations of the task within the prompt.
  - The examples serve as guidance for the model to perform the task effectively.
  - Including multiple examples can enhance the model's understanding and proficiency in completing the task.

- **Zero-Shot Prompting**:
  - In zero-shot prompting, the prompt includes only the task description without any accompanying examples.
  - The model is expected to perform the task based solely on the provided instructions.
  - Zero-shot prompting may require the model to generalize from previous knowledge or pre-training.

- **Variety in Prompt Design**:
  - Prompt design encompasses a wide range of strategies and styles tailored to specific tasks.
  - Examples include two-shot prompting for arithmetic problems, MPT-Instruct style prompts for instruction following, and detailed prompts for complex tasks like Bing Chat.
  - Different prompt engineering techniques can be employed to achieve desired model behavior across various domains and applications.

- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**:
  - Chain-of-thought prompting involves breaking down complex tasks into sequential steps within the prompt.
  - The model generates output by reasoning through each step in the chain, mimicking human problem-solving processes.
  - This approach has shown effectiveness in tackling multi-step tasks and improving model performance.

- **Least-to-Most Prompting**:
  - Least-to-most prompting requires the model to solve simpler subproblems before tackling more complex ones.
  - Solutions to simpler problems are used as building blocks for solving larger, more challenging problems.
  - This strategy aids in incrementally building the model's understanding and capabilities in problem-solving.

- **Conceptual Prompting**:
  - Conceptual prompting involves explicitly mentioning relevant concepts or principles required to solve a problem within the prompt.
  - By guiding the model to reason about fundamental concepts, it can better comprehend and solve complex questions in domains like physics and chemistry.
  - Conceptual prompting enhances the model's ability to perform domain-specific tasks by emphasizing conceptual understanding.
