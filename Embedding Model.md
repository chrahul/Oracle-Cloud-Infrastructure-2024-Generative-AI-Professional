### Embedding Models in OCI Generative AI Service

**Introduction to Embeddings:**
- Embeddings are numerical representations of text converted into number sequences, facilitating computer understanding of text relationships.
- They can represent words, phrases, sentences, or documents, aiding in tasks like translation, retrieval, and similarity measurement.

**Practical Use of Embeddings:**
- Illustration of how embeddings work with an encoder-decoder model for translation tasks.
- Word embeddings capture properties of words, enabling numerical similarity measurements and forming semantic clusters.
- Similarity measures like Cosine Similarity and Dot Product Similarity quantify numerical similarity between embeddings.

**Sentence Embeddings:**
- Similar to word embeddings, sentence embeddings assign numerical vectors to sentences, facilitating similarity comparison.
- Sentences with similar meanings have numerically similar vectors, aiding in tasks like text retrieval and classification.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
- RAG leverages embeddings to retrieve relevant documents or paragraphs from a large corpus and incorporate them into generative models for answering queries.
- Vector databases automate similarity searches, enabling efficient document retrieval based on user queries.
